# smol-to-others

Translate SMoL programs to other programming languages:

- JavaScript
- Python
- (WIP) Racket
- (WIP) OCaml

## Usage

```sh
racket main.rkt Examples/fact.smol
```

## Design decisions

Sometimes, the most "natural" translation does not preserve the semantics. For example, `(set! x 2)` produces the void value in smol while `x = 2` produces `2` in JavaScript. We decide to go for the natural translation because a goal of the whole smol project is to point out the consensus while *acknowledging* the differences.

TODO: Python non-local variables need to be declared. We also need to be careful about the distrinction between `nonlocal` and `global`.

## The supported subset of SMoL

### Know differences from the `#lang smol`

Immutable vectors are not supported. So `ivec` is not defined. `pair` is considered an alias of `mpair`.

`pair?` is not supported.

`and`, `or`, and `not` are not suported.

`++` is not supported.

`test/not` is not supported.

`spy` is not supported.

`let*` and `letrec` are not supported.

`zero?` are not supported.

Lists are not supported. So `cons`, `empty`, `list`, `map`, `filter`, `foldl`, and `foldr` are not provided.

Some identifiers are not allowed to be used as variables. Specifically,
the identifier must not be the same as one of the keywords and primitive operators.
Furthermore, only alphabetic characters, numeric characters, `-`, `_`, `*`, `!`, and `?` can appear in a variable. A variable must be non-empty and must not start with a number.

```
d ::= (defvar x e)
    | (deffun (f x ...) body)
e ::= c
    | x
    | (lambda (x ...) body)
    | (Î» (x ...) body)
    | (let ([x e] ...) body)
    | (if e e e)
    | (begin e ... e)
    | (set! x e)
    | (pair e e)
    | (mpair e e)
    | (left e)
    | (right e)
    | (set-left! e e)
    | (set-right! e e)
    | (mvec e ...)
    | (vec-len e)
    | (vec-ref e e)
    | (vec-set! e e e)
    | (equal? e e)
    | (eq? e e)
    | (o e ...)
    | (e e ...)
o ::= < | <= | > | >=
    | + | - | * | /

body    ::= d ... e ... e
program ::= d ... e ...
```
